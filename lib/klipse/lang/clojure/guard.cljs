  "The basic idea is that the first time a klipse snippet's cljs is evaluated, we kick off a go-loop whose job is to wake up every 100ms and update *watchdog-tick* to say: this is the last time that i woke up!

  And if (guard) gets run and notices that the watchdog hasn't been able to wake up within the last *max-eval-duration* milliseconds, it decides that we should kill the currently evaluating function, and does that by throwing an error.

  and this doesn't kill go-loops created by users' snippet code, because those go-loops won't block the watchdog from running.

; TODO is there a way to call the original emits function after the guard insertion - instead of pasting the original code. The problem is with the recursive call to emits

  1. It doesn't prevent infinite loop in imported code e.g. (reduce + (range)
