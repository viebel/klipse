Klipse is written in Clojurescript.


# How to run locally

from the terminal:

```bash
clj -M:figwheel --build dev --repl
```


From Cider, you should tell cider to launch clj with `:fig-cider` alias so that figwheel-main library is loaded.

Then, open the browser [http://localhost:5014/js-dbg.html](http://localhost:5014/js-dbg.html)

From now on, the code is auto-compiled on every changes.
You might need to refresh the test page to make sure the code changes were applied.

```

Open your browser and test the following test pages:

Production build: 

- http://localhost:5014/plugin-prod.html 
- http://localhost:5014/plugin-prod-more.html (some of the evaluators are incompatible on the same page)
- http://localhost:5014/plugin-prod-more-2.html (some of the evaluators are incompatible on the same page)

Dev build: 

- http://localhost:5014/plugin-dev.html
- http://localhost:5014/plugin-clojure-dev.html

## 3. Publish the npm package
