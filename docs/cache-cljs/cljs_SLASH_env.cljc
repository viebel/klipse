;; bit of a misnomer, but: an atom containing a map that serves as the bag of
;; state for the compiler, writ large (including analyzer, emitter, and
;; optimization stages). Each namespace has its own local var, to accommodate
;; multiple (lower-level) entry points.  Any state needed by the compiler across
;; multiple applications should be put into this map/atom.  Aside from
;; unfortunate current implementation details (e.g. depending on filesystem
;; state for certain things), the compiler should be idempotent with regard to
;; the environment passed to any entry point.
;;
;; Known slots in the compiler-env map:
;;
;; * :options - the [options] map argument, provided to this fn (defaults to {})
;; * :js-dependency-index - result from calling cljs.js-deps/js-dependency-index
;;   with [options]
;; * :cljs.analyzer/constant-table - map of (currently only keyword) constant
;;   values to fixed ids
;; * :cljs.analyzer/namespaces - map of symbols to "namespace" maps
;; * :cljs.analyzer/data-readers - literal map of symbols, where the first
;;   symbol in each pair is a tag that will be recognized by the reader. The
;;   second symbol in the pair is the fully-qualified name of a Var which will
;;   be invoked by the reader to parse the form following the tag.
;; * :cljs.compiler/compiled-cljs - cache of intermediate compilation results
;;   that speeds incremental builds in conjunction with source map generation
;; * :cljs.closure/compiled-cljs - cache from js file path to map of
;;   {:file .. :provides .. :requires ..}
;;
;; Note that this var is functionally private to the compiler, and contains
;; implementation-dependent data.
